# Internet Usage Control Using Access Control Technique
## Project Title – Internet Usage Control Using Access Control Technique using Cisco Packet Tracer
### Computer Communication and Network Project with Documentation


### Project Scope
```
On a network infrastructure, there are 100 users. All the users access internet through a Cisco router.
It was observed that the internet usage was very high which created problems like slow internet, expensive internet bills etc.
To solve the problem, the network has to be redesigned which would allow only browsing traffic and all other traffic bound to
the internet like FTP, Skype, etc. should be blocked.
